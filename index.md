## About Me
Hi, I'am a PhD student at George Mason University. I research in the field of interpretability of neural networks and its practical usage. Although neural networks exhibit remarkable performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, their inherent opaqueness poses a significant challenge.  This motivates my research to investigate the inner workings of neural networks through mechanistic interpretability, a subfield of interpretability that attempts to understand neural networks by reverse engineering them.
